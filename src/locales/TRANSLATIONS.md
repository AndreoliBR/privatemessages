# Translations
If you are interested in translating this bot into your language, or even improving existing translations, you have come to the right place.
Before starting, it is recommended that you have already used the bot a little to get a sense of what it is about. When you're ready, you can start editing the `en-US` file.
## Submitting your translation
You can send your translation through a pull request. If there are other pull requests, consider evaluating and improving them instead of submitting a new one.

*Keep in mind that translations that fall outside the context of the bot will not be accepted.*
