# Private Messages bot
[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/AndreoliBR/privmsgbot/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/AndreoliBR/privmsgbot)

Private Messages is a bot built using [Telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) and NodeJS. Its purpose is to create and manage paid messages, using its own currency. To access messages and their resources, the user must start the bot using the `/start` command.

*Have in mind: I know that the organization of the files is bad and messy, but I am changing that little by little. When this message disappears, the mess will also disappear.*

# Instalation
You can use the following commands to run this bot on a local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/AndreoliBR/privmsgbot.git folder-name
cd folder-name
yarn
```
